# Machine learning concerns making a computer learn from data and statistics.
#   - A machine learning program can be said to analyse data to learn to predict outcomes.

# A Data Set is any collection of data in a computer.
myList = [33, 24, 24, 21, 54, 33]

# The data in a data set has to be analysed to predict outcomes, so it important to know what
# data type is being dealt with.

# Numerical data (numbers)
#   - Discrete Data (numbers limited to integers)
#   - Continuous Data (numbers of an infinite value)

# Categorical data (values that cannot be measured against each other, such as colour values and yes/no values).

# Ordinal data (similar to categorical data, but can be measured against each other, such as comparing grades).
